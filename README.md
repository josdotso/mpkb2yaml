  - "OPS: Complete cable management in Rack #3."
  - "HR: Complete annual self-assessment."
  - "DEV: Attend Elixir meetup."

3. As you complete tasks, move them to column "1)" to signal that you've
   finished them.

4. When you're asked for a status update, visit the MPKB UI and click
   "Kanban -> Export".

5. At a \*NIX prompt (e.g. MacOS Terminal) run the following command.
   Note: Actual JSON file names will vary.a

    cat export.json | mpkb2yaml
